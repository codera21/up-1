    'AboutUsDescription' => "Why Opportunity \"4\"? Where the idea of Opportunity \"4\" came from? Thomas, CEO/Founder of Opportunity \"4\" was listening to an African president one day in his early teenage years and the president said something that changed his life! The president was giving a speech on how Africans can help each other, how best they can help someone in need! Answering his own question, he gave an example....
<br/> <br/>
He said the best way to help someone in need of fish to survive is \"not bringing fishes to the person everyday but is to bring the person to the fish\". This means that the best way to help someone is to make sure that after the help the person becomes independent, can be able to take care of himself and help other people to care of themselves too. That speech becomes the \"father\" of Opportunity \"4\" today. How?",
